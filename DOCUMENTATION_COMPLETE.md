## Key Documentation Changes

### Caching System Clarification

**Before**: Generic description of caching system

**After**: Clear, explicit documentation that:
- Cache is **NOT persistent** across page reloads
- Cache is **NOT persistent** across new browser tabs
- Cache is **NOT persistent** across new browser sessions
- Cache is **session-only** and memory-based
- Purpose was to optimize repeated lookups within a session
- Historical context: Implemented before Apollo GraphQL had caching

### Package Manager Clarification

**Before**: References to both npm and yarn

**After**: Exclusively npm:
- Prerequisites: npm 6.x or higher
- Installation: `npm install` only
- All commands: `npm run serve`, `npm run build`, etc.
- Lock file: `package-lock.json` (not yarn.lock)
- No yarn installation instructions

## Documentation Access

1. **Quick Start**: `/README.md`
2. **Detailed Guide**: `/documentation/dev/` (after running `npm run serve`)
3. **Caching Details**: `/documentation/dev/` ‚Üí "Custom Caching System" section
4. **Caching Clarification**: `/CACHING_SYSTEM_CLARIFICATION.md`
5. **Package Manager Info**: `/PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE.md`

## Verification Checklist

‚úÖ All yarn references removed (0 found in README.md, 0 in project-documentation.md)
‚úÖ All npm commands present (16 in README.md, 22 in project-documentation.md)
‚úÖ Session-only caching clearly documented
‚úÖ Historical context provided (Apollo GraphQL)
‚úÖ Last updated dates on all files
‚úÖ HTML documentation regenerated
‚úÖ No yarn.lock files in project root
‚úÖ package-lock.json confirmed as lock file

## For New Developers

### Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Understanding the Cache
- Cache is **session-only** (not persistent)
- Optimizes repeated page lookups within a session
- Cleared on page reload or new browser session
- See `/CACHING_SYSTEM_CLARIFICATION.md` for details

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run serve          # Development server
npm run build          # Production build
npm run lint           # Code linting
npm run build:search   # Generate search index
npm run docs:generate  # Generate all documentation
```

## Historical Notes

This custom caching system was implemented to optimize repeated page lookups within a single session. At the time of implementation, Apollo GraphQL did not have the robust caching features it has today. Since then, Apollo Client has evolved to include sophisticated caching mechanisms for GraphQL queries. However, this custom system remains in place and continues to provide session-level performance optimization.
