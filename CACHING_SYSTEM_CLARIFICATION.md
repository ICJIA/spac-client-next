# Caching System Clarification

**üìÖ Last Updated**: October 23, 2025

## Overview

The SPAC application uses a **session-only in-memory caching system** to optimize performance. This document clarifies what this means and provides important context about the system.

## Key Points

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Session-Only (NOT Persistent)

The cache is **NOT persistent** across:
- ‚ùå Page reloads (F5, Cmd+R)
- ‚ùå New browser tabs
- ‚ùå New browser sessions
- ‚ùå Closing and reopening the browser
- ‚ùå Navigating away and returning later

### ‚úÖ What IS Cached

The cache persists **only** for:
- ‚úÖ Repeated page lookups within the same browser session
- ‚úÖ Navigation between pages without reloading
- ‚úÖ The duration of the current browser tab

## Purpose

This custom caching system was implemented to **optimize repeated page lookups within a single session**. The goal was to:

1. Reduce redundant API calls when users revisit pages
2. Provide faster navigation within a browsing session
3. Minimize network traffic for repeated queries

## Historical Context

At the time this caching system was implemented, **Apollo GraphQL did not have robust caching features**. Since then, Apollo Client has evolved significantly and now includes:

- Sophisticated query result caching
- Automatic cache updates
- Persistent cache options
- Advanced cache management

However, this custom system remains in place and continues to provide session-level performance optimization for repeated content access.

## How It Works

### Cache Lifecycle

```
User opens browser
    ‚Üì
Page loads (cache is empty)
    ‚Üì
First query hits API, result is cached
    ‚Üì
User navigates to another page
    ‚Üì
Same query is found in cache (no API call)
    ‚Üì
User reloads page
    ‚Üì
Cache is cleared (empty again)
    ‚Üì
First query hits API again
```

### Implementation Details

- **Storage**: JavaScript `Map` in Vuex state (memory only)
- **Keys**: MD5 hashes of query identifiers
- **Scope**: Per browser tab
- **Lifetime**: Duration of browser session

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Identical queries within a session only hit the API once
2. **Faster Navigation**: Cached data loads instantly when revisiting pages
3. **Parallel Requests**: Multiple uncached queries execute in parallel
4. **Efficient**: Minimal memory overhead for typical usage

## Limitations

1. **No Cross-Session Persistence**: Cache is lost on page reload
2. **Memory-Based Only**: No persistent storage (localStorage, IndexedDB, etc.)
3. **Single Tab Only**: Each browser tab has its own independent cache
4. **Session-Specific**: Only useful for repeated lookups within a single session

## For Developers

### When Testing

- Keep the page open and navigate without reloading to see cache benefits
- Page reloads will clear the cache (expected behavior)
- Each new tab starts with an empty cache

### When Debugging

- Enable debug mode in `src/config.json` to see cache operations
- Check browser console for cache performance metrics
- Remember: First page load will always hit the API

### When Extending

- The caching system is transparent to components
- Add new queries following the existing pattern
- Cache invalidation happens automatically on app initialization

## Manual Cache Clearing

```javascript
// Clear all cached content
this.$store.commit("CLEAR_CACHE");

// Clear localStorage route tracking
this.$store.commit("CLEAR_LOCAL_STORAGE");
```

Use cases:
- After backend content updates
- When user explicitly requests a refresh
- During development/testing

## Future Considerations

If persistent caching is needed in the future, consider:
- Upgrading to Apollo Client's built-in caching
- Implementing localStorage-based persistence
- Using IndexedDB for larger datasets
- Implementing service worker caching

---

**Summary**: This is a session-only, in-memory caching system designed to optimize repeated page lookups within a single browsing session. It is not persistent and is cleared on page reload or new browser sessions.
