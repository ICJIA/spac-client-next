## Important Notes

- **No yarn.lock files** should be in the project root
- **Always use npm** for dependency management
- **package-lock.json** is the lock file (committed to repository)
- **All npm scripts** are defined in package.json
- **Documentation is auto-generated** from project-documentation.md
